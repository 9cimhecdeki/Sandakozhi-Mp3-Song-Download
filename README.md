Balu is an engineering student studying in Chennai, who visits his classmate and friend Karthik's home in Chidambaram after the final exams. Balu meets Karthik's sister Hema and they develop an affection which transforms into love. Kasi is the local gangster in Chidambaram who is feared by the entire town. On his way back to his place, Balu sees Kasi chasing a man with an aruval. When Kasi was about to kill the man he was chasing, Balu interferes and stops Kasi, who gets enraged and immediately tries to attack Balu, but Balu smashes Kasi in front of everyone to save himself and leaves.
 
Kasi is furious and wants vengeance against Balu. Kasi's men trap Karthik/Hema's father and learn about Balu's native place. Kasi sets goons to kill Balu but gets shocked when he learns that Balu's father is a powerful chieftain of Theni named Durai, and it will be difficult to attack them. Kasi leaves to Theni and waits for the right moment to kill Balu and his family. Balu meets Hema, Karthik and their family at a temple. Hema/Karthik's father is initially angered by seeing Balu as he was responsible to bring trouble by hitting Kasi, but Balu convinces him and both the families approve Balu and Hema's relationship.
 
One day, Kasi tries to kill Balu, but Durai get attacked instead. Durai understands that Balu is being targeted and decides to protect him. A localite in Theni hates Durai and his family and decides to help Kasi kill Durai. Kasi utilises the opportunity to kill Balu and Durai during a temple festival, but Balu saves Durai and fights Kasi. Durai asks Balu to fight with him. Balu thrashes Kasi and leaves, challenging him to return if he still has guts to finish him.

*Sandakozhi* was originally narrated for Vijay, but he declined the project without listening to the full script, and was replaced by Vishal.[3] Vishal worked hard for the role by taking courses in acting and dancing.[4] A fight scene involving Vishal and Lal was picturised in Dindigul for seven days. The songs have been shot at locations in Australia, New Zealand and Chennai. An introduction song for Rajkiran was shot at Theni.[5] The song "Ennamo Nadakirathe" was shot at Mauritius for six days.[6]
 
The soundtrack, composed by Yuvan Shankar Raja, teaming up for the first time with director N. Linguswamy and Vishal, was released on 25 November 2005. Both the film score as well as the songs were appreciated and praised as outstanding with the song "Dhavanipotta Deepavali" considered as the pick of the album.[7][8]
 
*Sify* wrote "*Sandakozhi* is a well-packaged film without any big stars or unwanted sentiments."[9] Malini Mannath of *Chennai Online* wrote "Sandakozhi is an engaging entertainer, an action-flick with a difference".[10] *Behindwoods* wrote "Lingusamy has given a total commercial entertainer."[11] Lajjavathi of *Kalki* wrote even though the impact of the film *Run* was visible at times, it was not boring. The first half is a non-stopping express and the second half is a fast-moving metro train with occasional stops. *Sandakozhi* which came out without major stars and any unnecessary sentiments is a *Jaikira Kozhi* (winning rooster).[12] *Vikatan* wrote Director Lingusamy's mixed taste shines in the tumultuous romance and thrilling action knots only if the liveliness and excitement of the first half had been the same in the second half, *Sandakozhi* could have been given a loud whistle.[13]
 
In December 2015, Linguswamy announced that he would direct the sequel of *Sandakozhi* with Vishal again, which was shelved. However, the project was revived in 2017 with Vishal confirming his presence in the sequel.[14] Rajkiran from the original has been retained in the sequel, with additional new cast involving Keerthy Suresh and Varalaxmi Sarathkumar.[15] The film released in 2018; however, it failed to replicate the success of its original film.
 
Grab your headset for another musical ride. Another element is random swaram. It is so mesmerizing because maximum of those swaram have been rendered by the man himself. Its so mellifluous it makes you feel wanting more. Few examples are yakkai thiri, kannalane, lukka chuppi.
 
This transformation of song from basic melody to a magical composition is consistently accomplished with his humming, and swaram, a solo humming by female singers and extensive usage of flute, at times Veena.
 
The song follows an unpredictable melody and rhythm pattern. And remarkably the melodious female voice belongs to a Chinese singer Caroline. It feel so amazing that a Chinese singer can pull off the tamil lyrics with such perfection. Versatility in a single song with these many elements is a big feat to achieve. Hear the whole song and look for all these elements. Magic and Pure magic.
 
Now the next aspect is the transformation of a song from slow melodic to a powerful fast number. The slow building of tempo from the starting of a song and ending in fast tempo like Acccham acham illai from the movie Indira. The first half of the song is filled with just the main female voice, chorus and some mild music. There are only very mild percussion engaged in the song till that point.
 
PS: This is purely for entertainment and a soul filling habit to get addicted to music and music. If it opens to a discussion about music I am more than happy to have it ? . Honest feedback are needed to make this more beautiful journey.
 
While some singers establish their uniqueness through voice experimentation, Madhushree has largely stuck to her signature style. She attributes this to her mother Prabti Bhattacharya and mentor AR Rahman.
 
While the singer is widely lauded for the sweetness of her voice, there has been the occasional criticism about her Tamil diction. Madhushree, who remains well-aware of such feedback, promises to get it right in her upcoming songs.
 
National Award winning actor Dhanush is not only an accomplished actor but a singer as well. He made his debut as a playback singer with Pudhukottaiyil Irundhu Saravanan way back in 2004 and since then has been rendering songs consistently. Interestingly, his first song was set to tune by his close friend Yuvan Shankar Raja but he shot into the limelight with the Why this Kolaveri Di number from 3, which was composed by Anirudh. The song was a sensational hit among the masses.
 
And now, Dhanush is all set to add one more song to his discography. Reports indicate that actor Vishal had requested Dhanush to sing a song in his upcoming Sandakozhi 2 for which Yuvan is wielding the music baton and he had agreed immediately. Sources in the know say that the song has been recorded already and it has come out well.
 
It is indeed a good gesture by Dhanush to be associated with Sandakozhi 2 despite his own busy schedules. He is currently busy with Enai Noki Paayum Thota, Vada Chennai, and the English movie The Extraordinary Journey of the Fakir.
 
Directed by N Lingusamy and produced by Vishal under his banner Vishal Film Factory, Sandakozhi 2 stars Vishal in the lead with Varalaxmi Sarathkumar and Keerthy Suresh as the heroines. The star cast also includes Rajkiran and Harish Siva. While Yuvan Shankar Raja will be composing the tunes for this film, Shakthi will be cranking the camera for this April 2018 release.
